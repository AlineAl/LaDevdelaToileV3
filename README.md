### Add your known **events around web development with conferences** links in the `src/datas` folder
/!\ Create an event around web development with conferences ONLY IF NOT EXISTS

1 - First, you need to create a folder
- Go to the `datas` folder
- Go to the `conferences` folder
- Create a new folder with the name of the conference. For example, if you want to add a new conference for AFUP, create a folder named `AFUP`
- Inside the folder, create, for example for AFUP, a file named `AFUPconferences.ts`
- Add in the file your conferences concerned by AFUP with the following format:
```
    {
        title: 'Write title of the conference here',
        description: 'Add a low description',
        path: 'Share the path of the conference here'
    }
```

2 - Second, you need to create a page
- Go to the `pages` folder
- Go to the `conferences` folder
- Create a new file with the following format. For example, if you want to add a new conference for AFUP, create a file named `AFUP.astro`:
```
    ---
    import Layout from "../../layouts/Layout.astro";
    import NavBar from "../../components/NavBar.astro";
    import { AFUPConferences } from "../../datas/conferences/AFUP/AFUPconferences";
    import List from "../../components/List.astro";
    ---
    <Layout title="AFUP" >
        <NavBar />
        <List data={AFUPConferences} imagePath="/_759b362e-6183-40dc-a54e-53a925c20be1.jpeg" />
    </Layout>
```
